NIRTools was developed to help users in documenting and building NIR datasets in an easy way.

Let's pratice.

First we need a dataset to work on. I incorporated a small dataset, based on a group of Neotropical plants, focus of my PhD. Let's load it.

```{r}
library(NIRtools)
```

```{r}
head(nir_data)
```

After that, let's create a parameter file that will contain all specifications of my first dataset. FOr that, let's use function `write_NIRparams`.
